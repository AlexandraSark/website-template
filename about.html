The Digital Humanities Research Institute (DHRI) is a ten-day residential workshop to be held from June 11 - 20, 2018 at The Graduate Center, CUNY. Participants will develop core computational research skills through hands-on workshops, explore interdisciplinary digital humanities research and teaching with leading DH scholars, and begin developing versions of the DHRI for their own communities. Over the following academic year, each participant will have access to an online network of peers, as well as 20 hours of consultation from our experienced staff while they lead their own DHRI. Participants will return to New York in June 2019 to report on their experiences and contribute to a guide to leading DHRIs in a variety of institutional contexts.
